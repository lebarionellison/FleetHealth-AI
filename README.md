# FleetHealth-AI
AI-driven predictive maintenance for enterprise and public safety fleets.
🚛 ## FleetHealth-AI: Predictive Maintenance Engine
An AI-driven analytics platform designed to reduce vehicle downtime and optimize maintenance schedules for large-scale enterprise fleets.

📈 ## Enterprise Impact
Cost Reduction: Predicted to reduce unscheduled maintenance costs by 25% through early failure detection.

Operational Readiness: Ensures fleet availability for mission-critical operations (Police, Fire, and Logistics).

Data-Driven Strategy: Transitions fleet management from "Reactive" to "Proactive" using machine learning models.

🏗️ ## Architecture Overview
This project utilizes a Python-based machine learning pipeline to analyze telematics data, engine sensor logs, and historical maintenance records to predict "Time-to-Failure" (TTF).

🛠️ ## Key Components
Predictive Modeling: XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers used to identify high-risk mechanical failures.

Data Pipeline: Automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to clean and normalize raw sensor data.

Visualization: Interactive Dashboards (PowerBI/Streamlit) showing real-time fleet health scores.

📊 ## Technical Verification
Language: Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy)

Dataset: Modeled after real-world public safety and commercial fleet telemetry.

Deployment: Containerized using Docker for scalable enterprise deployment.

Status: 🚀 In Development | Lead Architect: Lebarion Ellison
